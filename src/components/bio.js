        <h1>Hi! I'm Faye 👋</h1>
           
        <p>A community manager based in Munich, Germany 🥨🍺. I love being involved with tech communities so much that I decided to help others build their own.</p>
         
         <p>I currently work as the Checkmk Community Manager at tribe29. A significant amount of my experience in tech community building came from volunteering with Mozilla 🦊, where I helped build local and student communities in my free time.</p>

         <p>Would be happy to answer questions about community management especially in open source, and how to properly cook rice. DMs open!</p>
      
         <p>Opinions are my own.</p>
