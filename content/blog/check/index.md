Oh hi.
This will be for now a placeholder post to setup my new blog on Gatsby + GH Pages, to let go of my other blog that has been running on Wordpress. Which means, I am cutting on expenses for a hosting, yay!

Ok I lied, I have set this up for a while now but there was no urgency to move things until the deadline of the payment for the hosting, so here we are.

Well, tbh it didn't cost that much. It's like what, USD 80 a year?

It can be a bit sad to let go of that Wordpress blog since it kept all my stuff intact since 2011. But I guess it's better to hide your teenage angst from the Internet and put in the chest down the cellar where it belongs.
