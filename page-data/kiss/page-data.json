Should be easy to do… in JavaScript? (Spoiler alert: I don’t code, especially if your standard of ~rEaL cOdInG~ doesn’t involve ~jUsT mArKuP lAnGuAgEs~)</p>\n<p>Anyway. I asked my husband the keyword I should search for to do such thing and from him I learned this function called <code class=\"language-text\">Math.random()</code>. </p>\n<p>Cool. Saw it quickly on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random\">MDN</a>. Ok too comprehensive. That’s a lot of unknown terms. Saw it on <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp\">W3Schools</a>. There you go, the straightforward stuff!</p>\n<p>Great, time to look at how other people do it! Or maybe not…</p>\n<h2>Why are there no simple examples anymore???</h2>\n<p>I looked at maybe 5 tutorials of how to make a ‘simple’ raffle in JavaScript with code snippets and link to their code on GitHub. I seriously just want a skeleton of how it works, and yet all the tutorials has loads of styling and I’m pretty sure someone even had to use Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>And you blame people why they just copy paste nowadays?</p>\n<p>Anyway, done with the rant, time to write about a sample of a simple tutorial.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Keep It Simple, Stroopwafel","date":"March 14, 2020","description":"Jesus Christ why is it so difficult to find a straightforward example of a simple task that I want to accomplish on the Internet"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/kiss/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/she-works-therefore-she-is/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"She works therefore she is"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/legit-simple-raffle-js/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create a simple raffle draw in JavaScript"}}}}}
