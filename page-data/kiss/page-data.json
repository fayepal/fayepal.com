Should be easy to do… in JavaScript? (Spoiler alert: I don’t code, especially if your standard of ~rEaL cOdInG~ doesn’t involve ~jUsT mArKuP lAnGuAgEs~)</p>\n<p>Anyway. I asked my husband the keyword I should search for to do such thing and from him I learned this function called <code class=\"language-text\">Math.random()</code>. </p>\n<p>Cool. Saw it quickly on <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random\">MDN</a>. Ok too comprehensive. That’s a lot of unknown terms. Saw it on <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp\">W3Schools</a>. There you go, the straightforward stuff!</p>\n<p>Great, time to look at how other people do it! Or maybe not…</p>\n<h2>Why are there no simple examples anymore???</h2>\n<p>I looked at maybe 5 tutorials of how to make a ‘simple’ raffle in JavaScript with code snippets and link to their code on GitHub. I seriously just want a skeleton of what it works, and yet all the tutorials has shitloads of styling and I’m pretty sure someone even had to use Bootstrap.</p>\n<p>And you freaking blame people why they just copy paste nowadays? Honey, people will have to go through these tutorials with lots of extra toppings in it that they have to dig further to find where the brownie is. Ain’t nobody got time for that! Not to mention the unnecessary cognitive overload the reader has to take.</p>\n<p>Anyway, done with the rant, time to write about a sample of a simple tutorial.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Keep It Simple, Stroopwafel","date":"March 14, 2020","description":"Jesus Christ why is it so difficult to find a straightforward example of a simple task that I want to accomplish on the Internet"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/kiss/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/legit-simple-raffle-js/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create a simple raffle draw in JavaScript"}},"next":null}}}
