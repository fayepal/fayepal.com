This will be for now a placeholder post to setup my new blog on Gatsby + GH Pages, to let go of my other blog that has been running on Wordpress. Which means, I am cutting on expenses for a hosting, yay!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok I lied, I have set this up for a while now but there was no urgency to move things until the deadline of the payment for the hosting, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, tbh it didn’t cost that much. It’s like what, USD 80 a year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be a bit sad to let go of that Wordpress blog since it kept all my stuff intact since 2011. But I guess it’s better to hide your teenage angst from the Internet and put in the chest down the cellar where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
